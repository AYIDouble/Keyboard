# ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard ‚å®Ô∏è
A Simple **Java Library** for controlling the **Keyboard**, it is:

- **Easy** to use
- **Powerful**
- And has **many Functions**

I searched long to find a simple **Keyboard Library** for **Java** but I have found nothing that fits,
so I wrote a simple **Java Library** to access the **Keyboard**.

## üìù Example üìù

([**As an example, I used it to program a game controller with Arduino (JArduino).**](https://github.com/AYIDouble/IOT-Arduino-Game-Controller-Java))

```
import java.awt.AWTException;
import java.util.ArrayList;

import com.sun.glass.events.KeyEvent;

import Keyboard.Keyboard;

public class Main {

	static Keyboard keyboard;
	
	public static void main(String[] args) throws AWTException, InterruptedException {
		keyboard = new Keyboard();
		ArrayList keyyy = new ArrayList<KeyEvent>();
		keyboard.type("Cool, ");
		keyboard.type("I can write this in just one line");
		keyboard.press(KeyEvent.VK_WINDOWS);
	}
}
```
